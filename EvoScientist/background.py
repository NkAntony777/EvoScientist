"""Background OS-process execution for the sandbox.

A *process* here is a single detached OS process launched via ``run_in_background``
(distinct from an async sub-agent *task* and a future cron *schedule* — the word
"job" is intentionally never used).

The registry is **module-global (process-level)**: processes survive ``/new`` and
``/resume`` within the same CLI process, but are not persisted across a CLI restart.
The live ``Popen`` handle is held so ``poll()`` / ``returncode`` stay authoritative
(no PID-reuse risk).

Command validation and cwd resolution happen at the tool layer
(``middleware/background.py``); this module is the pure execution + tracking mechanism
and is safe to unit-test on its own. A future scheduler (cron) would reuse ``launch``.

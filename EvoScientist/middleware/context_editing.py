    The base class applies its edits inside ``(a)wrap_model_call``, where the
    current run's model is available on ``request.model`` — which, on the
    server backend, is already the per-run ``configurable.model`` override
    (``ConfigurableModelMiddleware`` sits earlier in the stack and swaps it).
    This subclass resizes the first edit's trigger there, whenever the model
    differs from the one the current trigger was computed for. Triggers are
    cached per resolved context window — the trigger is a pure function of
    it, real chat models are unhashable pydantic objects and cannot key a
    cache, and distinct models sharing a window share a trigger value
    anyway — so steady-state model calls cost one dict lookup.

    The trigger mutation happens right before the synchronous edit pass with
    no ``await`` in between, so async runs on one event loop cannot interleave
    it. Parallel sync subagent runs in threads could in principle race the
    mutation; the worst case is one run trimming with the other model's
    trigger — the same over/under-trim the frozen-trigger design had.

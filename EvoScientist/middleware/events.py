"""Typed middleware → frontend event sink.

This module lives deliberately inside ``middleware/`` so the dependency
direction is always **frontends → middleware**, never the reverse. Middleware
reports facts about what happened during a model call; a frontend supplies a
sink implementation that owns its own display state and renders (or ignores)
those facts.

Two families of events are evidenced today and modelled here:

* **Tool selection** — the adaptive ``LLMToolSelectorMiddleware`` wrapper
  reports when a selection LLM call starts, which tools survived filtering,
  and when it ends.
* **Model fallback** — the fallback middleware reports lifecycle narration for
  failed primary calls and fallback attempts.

Tool-selection events are structured. Fallback notices are pre-formatted
narration plus a style, because the middleware owns the wording and the sink
only decides where to display it.

Threading / blocking contract
-----------------------------
Sink methods may be called **from any thread**: synchronous middleware hooks
run on LangChain worker threads, async hooks on whichever loop runs the graph.
A sink implementation therefore MUST be:

* **thread-safe** — any state it mutates is touched under its own lock, and
* **non-blocking** — it marshals to its UI itself (Textual:
  ``call_from_thread`` / ``post_message``; Rich: the console's internal lock)
  and returns promptly.

A sink that blocks stalls the model call that emitted the event — the emitting
worker thread is held until the sink returns. Nothing in the framework isolates
a slow sink from the run.

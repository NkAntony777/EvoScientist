"""Async sub-agent auto-notification.

Completions are detected from thread state by the client-side reader
(:func:`enqueue_completions_from_state`): it reads deepagents' ``async_tasks``
registry through the graph gateway, checks each active task's live run status,
and enqueues a lightweight notification onto a thread-safe queue. The CLI loop
drains the queue, dedups against ``async_tasks`` state, batches survivors, and
injects a synthetic user message that triggers one LLM turn. The reader runs at
every turn/stream-close boundary and, throttled, on the idle poll tick
(:func:`enqueue_completions_from_state_throttled`) so a completion still surfaces
while the user sits idle.
